# 2D Motion Planning with Minkowski Sum and A* Search
This mini project implements a 2D motion planning algorithm that finds a collision free path for a square robot navigating among rectangular obstacles.
The algorithm computes the configuration space using Minkowski Sum and performs A* search over a graph built from randomly sampled points.

## Install
pip install numpy shapely matplotlib
```
```

## Usage
All functionality is implemented in a single Python file.
Run python src/motionPlanner.py directly to execute.

Youâ€™ll be prompted to define rectangular obstacles manually in the format:

x_left, y_bottom, x_right, y_top

```
```
